# CSCI 213 Lab 10: Working with Git

**Author:** Patrick Ball

This is the Git lab for CSCI 213 Software Development. One class was added, `Car.java`, which extends the abstract `Vehicle` class. The `Car` class contains the following:

* Two instance variables
* A parameterized constructor for all current and super instance variables
* Getters for the instance variables in this class
* The `toString` method
* The `equals` method
* A `copy` method
